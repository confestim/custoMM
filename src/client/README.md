# Client

Heavily W.I.P. at the moment.


## Config

Create a file called `config.py` and fill it with the following values(relevant to you):

```
SITE_URL = "your-server.com"

```

## Releases
Check out the releases for pre-compiled binaries of the client and server.

## TODOs

1. [x] Make the server and client talk to each other
    * [x] Based on MMR
    * [x] Based on cached IDs
